# Week 8: A/B Testing

From [Controlled experiments on the web: survey and practical guide](http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/2009controlledExperimentsOnTheWebSurvey.pdf):

> The web provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate ideas quickly using controlled experiments, also called randomized experiments, A/B tests (and their generalizations), split tests, Control/Treatment tests, MultiVariable Tests (MVT) and parallel flights. Controlled experiments embody the best scientific design for establishing a causal relationship between changes and their influence on user-observable behavior. We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where endusers can help guide the development of features. Our experience indicates that significant learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen when development teams listen to their customers, not to the Highest Paid Personâ€™s Opinion.

This week you will learn:

* Why controlled experiment is important
* What the multi-armed bandit is, and how it relates to controlled experimentation
* How to run a successful A/B test

## Reading Assignment

Introduction to [Fairness and Machine Learning: Limitations and Opportunities](https://fairmlbook.org/pdf/fairmlbook.pdf) by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, Arvind Narayanan. (**note** Just the introduction)

*and*

"Confident Data Skills" by Kirill Eremenko, chapter 7.

I really like the paper [Controlled experiments on the web: survey and practical guide](http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/2009controlledExperimentsOnTheWebSurvey.pdf).  Some of the lecture was taken from there.

Evan Miller's [blog posts about A/B testing](https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html) are the most clear I have seen.  There are also [handy calculators](https://www.evanmiller.org/announcing-evans-awesome-ab-tools.html)!

A good jumping off point for learning more is the Wikipedia page [Multi-armed bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit).
