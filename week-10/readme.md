# Machine Learning

This week we will look at a few simple machine learning algorithms, clustering and classification.

### Assignment

Professional networking is important, especially when getting started in data science.  An important part of the process is having an online presence.  That could be social media (linkedin, twitter), technical (github), a blog or personal page, or even a resume that you can email.  But you want something that communicates who you are, and what you can do.

So do that now!  Get started with one of those, and send it to me.  I will add / follow you, and give feedback about how you might improve it.
