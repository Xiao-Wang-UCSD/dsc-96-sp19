# Week 6: Audio

This week focuses on audio recordings as a source of data.

We will start by learning a little about how computers store audio recordings, and then create our own from scratch in Python.  Next, we will start with a recording of a voice and do some simple digital signal processing to remove long pauses.  Finally, we will use a pre-made API to do speech recognition.

By the end of the week you will:
* Know how audio signals can be created and modified with code
* Have done some digital signal processing (DSP)
* Examined the sensitivity of audio classification to noise.
