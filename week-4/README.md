# Week 4: Communicating Results

This is our final week with Tableau.  By the end of the week you will have built an interactive dashboard using the SDPD traffic stop data and put it online for the world to see.

The two big themes this week are 

1. mapping and
2. how to communicate results effectively.  

## Reading Assignment

Communicating:
1. [What the data says](https://pudding.cool/2018/07/women-in-congress/) and
2. a narrative out of the data (e.g. a [538 story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/murder-rates-dont-tell-us-everything-about-gun-violence/))

## Links

I found making a map from the .geojson file confusing, and [this link](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_shapefiles.html#Build) was very helpful.
